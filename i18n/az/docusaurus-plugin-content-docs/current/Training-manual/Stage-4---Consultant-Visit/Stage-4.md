The fourth stage of an SIL translation project is the consultant visit. You will meet with the consultant and evaluate your text, make notes and revise your texts and back translations as needed. You will want to ensure that you have updated the status of your translation in Assignments and Progress.


Most of the tasks in this stage have been covered in previous modules.


The following module will help you in this stage:


 20.  [Collaboration Tools](/20.CT)
