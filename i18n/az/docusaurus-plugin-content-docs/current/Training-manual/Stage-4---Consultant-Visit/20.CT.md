Paratext Live has changed in Paratext 9.3.

:::




**Introduction**  In this module you will use Paratext Live as a way that the team can collaborate together so that everyone can see the changes to the text on their own computers.


**Before you start**  We have already seen how to collaborate with Send/Receive. There are times, for example during a consultant check, when several people need to look at the same text, and perhaps edit it together. Paratext Live allows everyone to look at the text on their own computer and see the changes being made in real time.


**Why this is important**  There are several other ways to let everyone look at the same text. But Paratext Live not only lets everyone see the text, but it also allows more than one person to edit the text.


**What are you going to do?**

- Connect all users to the same network.
- Send/Receive.
- Start Paratext Live and join a session
- Edit the document
- Exchange all files
- Exit Paratext Live
- Məlumat mübadilə et

:::info

 [4.1 Collaboration Tools](https://vimeo.com/641947293)  The video has been revised for Paratext 9.3.

:::




:::tip

You may want to try switching to screen sharing (using a tool like Skype or Zoom) while working on spelling, Biblical terms, etc, so everyone can see the changes. And then switch back to using Paratext Live as it requires lower bandwidth.

:::caution Upgrade


Paratext 9.3 allows you to choose a server. Everyone in a particular live session still needs to use the same server (either Primary or Secondary), it is just that from 9.3 you can work with someone on 9.1 or someone else on 9.2 (**just not at the same time**.)

## 20.1 Paratext Live {#cfbebfcb20e14db89426a01336737f92}


:::tip

It is no longer required for all users to do a **send/receive** before starting but if Paratext detects too many changes it will advise that you do a send/receive. Everyone must be connected to the same network.
