# **CV: Convert a Project** {#238598a5fd4080aa8ca3d773eab1eca5}

**8.1 Introduction**

If you ever need to rename your project, reduce its size, change user names, change the encoding, or struggle with compound/decompound diacritics, the **Convert Project** tool will help you solve these problems.

_**Where are we?**_

You must be the project administrator to make these conversions.

_**Why is this skill important?**_

Only a few changes can be made to the project in the project's **Properties and settings**. Major changes require a new project to be created. The **Convert project** tool allows the new project to retain the project history.

_**What are we going to do?**_

We will work through the six changes that can be made to your project.

- Change the short name of the project
- Remove deleted files from the project history
- Clear the Paratext Live history
- Convert the encoding to 65001 â€” Unicode [UTF8]
- Normalisation â€” compound or decomposed
- Replace old user names

**8.2 The â€˜Convert Projectâ€™ dialogue box**

- **Tab** under **Tools**, select **Advanced**, then **Convert Project**

**8.2.1 Change the short name of the project**

- Confirm that the old project name is correct. [If not, close the dialogue box, click on the correct project window and go to the New dialogue box.]
- Enter the new short name for the project in **[1]**.

**8.2.2 Scan for deleted files in project history**

- **[2]** Select this option if you have deleted files [such as large illustrations] that you no longer want to be part of the project history.

**8.2.3 Clean up Paratext Live history**

- **[3]** Select this option if you have edited the project with Paratext Live and want to replace the names in the project history.

**8.2.4 Convert encoding to 65001 â€” Unicode [UTF8]**

- **[4]** Select this option to convert a standard Unicode encoding project.

:::tip

This will not work to change the encoding if your project contains a â€˜pirated fontâ€™. Normalisation â€“ compound or decomposed.

:::

**8.2.5 Normalisation**

- **[5]** Select Compound [NFC] or one of the options in the drop-down list if the data in your project contains a mixture of compound and decomposed characters.

**8.2.6 Replacing old user names**

- **[6]** Select the name of the user you want to replace from the drop-down list.
- **[7]** Type the name of a registered Paratext user in this box.
- **[8]** Click **Add**,

a summary of the replacement is displayed with a â€˜Removeâ€™ button.

- [If you make a mistake when typing the name in the **With** field or decide not to make the replacement, click **Remove**].
