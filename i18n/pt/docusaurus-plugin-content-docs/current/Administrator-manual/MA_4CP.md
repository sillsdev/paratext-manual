# **CP: Create a new project** {#238598a5fd4080d28e44d73f28d5b402}

_**Introduction**_ In this module, you will create and register a new project.

_**Where are we?**_  You have already installed Paratext 9 and registered a user.

_**Why is this skill important?**_  A new feature in Paratext 8 and 9 is that projects and users must be registered. This may seem like a complication, but it offers advantages to users.

As we saw in the user registration section, the administrator of a project can create registrations for users they want to participate in their project.

_**What are we going to do?**_  We will create and register a new project.

## **4.2 Creating a new project** {#238598a5fd408040a28fd03938ff47a0}

- **≡ Paratext**, under **Paratext** &gt; **New Project**
    - _The Project Properties and Settings dialogue box appears._

### **4.2.1 Changing the project name** {#238598a5fd40804b9bb7fbe123385613}

- Click the **Edit** button
    - _The_ _**Edit Full Name**_ _dialogue box appears_
- In the **Full Name** section, type a name that includes the language name
- Under **Short Name**, type the **ISO** code for the language.

:::caution

Once you create a project name, the short name cannot be changed, as this is the name Paratext will give to the folder containing the project files, as well as the name given to the project on the Internet server. (However, you can convert the project to a new project with a different short name. But converting a project can take many hours.)

### **4.2.2 Specifying the language** {#238598a5fd4080468c76e61de7481949}

:::tip

If you have another Paratext project in the same language, you can already choose the language from the list in Paratext **[2]**. Otherwise, you will need to create a new language.

:::

- Click **New**
    - _The_ _**Choose a language identifier**_ _dialog box appears_.
- Click in the **Search** box
- Start typing the name of your language
    - _Paratext displays the matching names._
- Click your language in the list.
    - _Paratext adds the language name._
- Fill in the fields in the Advanced section, if necessary.
- Clique em **OK**.

:::tip

You can also specify additional information if necessary in the ‘Advanced’ section of the language settings dialogue box.

:::

### **4.2.3 Project type** {#238598a5fd408099bf7ed09849b689b1}

- Click the drop-down list next to **Project type**
- Choose the appropriate type for your project.

:::tip

If this is a dependent project such as a retranslation, child translation or transliteration project, you will need to define the source.

:::

### **4.2.4 Register the new project** {#238598a5fd40808cb3fad1807206c360}

- Make sure you have given the project a name and selected the project type.
- Click **Register online** to access the registration page.
- Fill in the information (see above).
- Click **Register** to submit and return to Paratext.
    - _Paratext should ‘automatically’ detect that the project has been registered._
- Click **OK** to create the new project.

Project types that do not need to be registered separately

- Projects that inherit registration from parent
- Retranslation
- Transliteration
- ‘Auxiliary’
- Advisor notes

## **4.3 Modify your registration** {#238598a5fd408020af47fe0581eb354b}

When working on your project, you can modify your registration information later.

- In Paratext, make sure you have an Internet connection,
- **≡ Tab**, under **Project** &gt; **Project Properties** &gt; **Project Settings**
- Click on the **Manage Registration** link

:::tip

Your registration information will be displayed. An administrator can modify the information.
