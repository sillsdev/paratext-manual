**Introduction** In this module, you will learn how to save your text at various points and review them later.


**Before you start** You have worked on your text and you have arrived at an important stage of your project.


**Why is this important?**  As you work on your translation, you will be continually making changes. It is good to have a copy of your text as it was at a particular point, for example as it was before you went to a consultant check.


**What will you do?**  You will mark a point in the history of the project. Later you can compare the text at different points.


### 18.1 Mark Point in History {#6bc0d79911234870b4fe00d7193f8414}

1. Click in your project window to make it active (in Paratext).
2. **≡ Tab** under **Project** &gt; **Mark a point in project history**
3. Type a comment to describe the point.
4. Click **OK**

:::tip

It is good to start the comment with some symbols, like **##**, to easily identify the points you have added in the long list of automatic points that Paratext creates.
