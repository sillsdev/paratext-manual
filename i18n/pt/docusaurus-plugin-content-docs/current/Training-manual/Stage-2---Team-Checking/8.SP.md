**Introduction**  This module explains how to check for spelling mistakes in the text you have typed into your project in Paratext 9.


**Before you start**  You have typed your text in Paratext 9 and have done some checks, but there may still be spelling mistakes.


**Why is this important?**  It is important to correct any spelling mistakes so that your text will communicate clearly.


**What you are going to do**  Configure the wordlist to build up a base of correct words.

- Work through your text with red squiggly lines showing words that Paratext does not know are correct.
- Work through your wordlist, either correcting mistakes or telling Paratext 9 that the words are correct.
- Use a variety of checks from the wordlist.
- Add a spelling discussion note to words that need further discussion before deciding on a correct spelling.

## 8.1 Configure the word list {#7490cb4639dc4f2d9eb8ac343d7e79c2}


:::tip

Before you can check the spelling, it is important to have a base of words that are known to be correct. There are three things we can do:

:::




### Approve the spelling of common words {#c86b35e4794640e980a0796316c04f29}


In Paratext

- **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** &gt; **Wordlist**

In the Wordlist

1. **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** &gt; **Approve spelling of common words**
2. Enter a number

    :::tip

    The number is the number of times the words must appear to automatically mark it as being spelled correctly. The default is 100, but you can choose more (if you have doubts about the text) or less (if you are confident about the accuracy of the typist).


:::



3. Click **OK**
4. Click **Yes** (to confirm that you cannot undo)

### Check the words that Paratext thinks are incorrect {#bf5578928c41416f955b0ffa478e72af}

- Make sure you are in the Wordlist.
    - _If you are back in Paratext Window, go to the Wordlist (__**≡ Tab**_ _under_ _**Tools**_ _>_ _**Wordlist****)*
- **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** &gt; **Spell Check &gt; All checks**
    - _A list of words is displayed._

<div class='notion-row'>
<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.6875)'}}>

- Click on a word in the top pane.
    1. If the word is **correct** – click on the green icon at the top of the column
    2. If the word is **incorrect**, but Paratext 9 has **suggested** the correct word, then click the **blue link** for the correct word.
    3. If the word is **incorrect**, and Paratext 9 **hasn’t suggested** the correct word, click on the red checkbox and correct the word. (See 8.1)

</div><div className='notion-spacer'></div>

<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.31249999999999994)'}}>

### Check similarly spelled words {#1fdc348be8334ff6841f08689c4aaae5}


In the Wordlist

1. **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** &gt; **Find Similar Words**
2. Enter letters which sound alike separated by / (e.g. s/sh/z)

    :::tip

    Depending on your language, tick or untick “Ignore all diacritics when comparing words”.


:::




 3.  Click **OK**

    - _A list of words is displayed._

 4.  Correct the words (as described above).


## 8.2 Spell checking – from the text {#66602cff1c654a81ae88a1f8b7e7842f}


In Paratext

- **≡ Tab**, under **View** &gt; **Display spelling**

:::tip

A progress meter is displayed initially, then all the words that are either unknown or incorrect have red squiggly lines underneath.

:::




### Making corrections {#a468ce2f5f594dcbbd8446fd4225814b}


:::tip

Paratext 9 will underline in red the words that have not been approved in the word list. This either means that the word is misspelled or unknown.

:::




<div class='notion-row'>
<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5)'}}>

1. Right-click a word which is underlined in either red or grey
    - _A dialogue is displayed_

2. Either type the correction in the box or select the correct word from the list

3. Click **OK**

</div><div className='notion-spacer'></div>

<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5)'}}>


![](./1093019645.png)


</div><div className='notion-spacer'></div>
</div>

:::tip

When possible, it is better to use the spelling check even when making minor corrections as Paratext 9 will remember the correction, and you can apply the correction if it happens again.

:::




When there is more than one correction, a dialog box is displayed.


Choose as appropriate:

- **Yes** = changes this verse and looks for the next
- **No** = skips this verse and looks for the next
- Yes to all – **is dangerous**, use with caution
- **Cancel** = stops further changes
