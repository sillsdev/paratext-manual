**Introduction**  This module explains how to check for spelling mistakes in the text you have typed into your project in Paratext 9.


**Before you start**  You have typed your text in Paratext 9 and have done some checks, but there may still be spelling mistakes.


**Why is this important?**  It is important to correct any spelling mistakes so that your text will communicate clearly.


**What you are going to do**  Configure the wordlist to build up a base of correct words.

- Work through your text with red squiggly lines showing words that Paratext does not know are correct.
- Work through your wordlist, either correcting mistakes or telling Paratext 9 that the words are correct.
- Use a variety of checks from the wordlist.
- Add a spelling discussion note to words that need further discussion before deciding on a correct spelling.

## 8.1 Configure the word list {#7490cb4639dc4f2d9eb8ac343d7e79c2}


:::tip

Before you can check the spelling, it is important to have a base of words that are known to be correct. There are three things we can do:

:::




### Approve the spelling of common words {#c86b35e4794640e980a0796316c04f29}


In Paratext

- **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** &gt; **Wordlist**

In the Wordlist

1. **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** &gt; **Approve spelling of common words**
1. Enter a number

    :::tip

    The number is the number of times the words must appear to automatically mark it as being spelled correctly. The default is 100, but you can choose more (if you have doubts about the text) or less (if you are confident about the accuracy of the typist).


:::



1. Click **OK**
1. Click **Yes** (to confirm that you cannot undo)

### Check the words that Paratext thinks are incorrect {#bf5578928c41416f955b0ffa478e72af}

- Make sure you are in the Wordlist.
    - _If you are back in Paratext Window, go to the Wordlist (__**≡ Tab**_ _under_ _**Tools**_ _>_ _**Wordlist****)*
- **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** &gt; **Spell Check &gt; All checks**
    - _A list of words is displayed._
