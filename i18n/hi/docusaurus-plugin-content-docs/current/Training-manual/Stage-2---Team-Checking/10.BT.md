title: 10. A 4-Step process for consistent Biblical Term

---



**Introduction**  The _Biblical terms rendering_ window and the separate _Biblical terms_ tool are very useful to make sure you are consistent in the use of terms, especially key terms. With many terms over many books this can become quite a task. This module explains a simple 4-step process to make your Biblical Terms consistent. You should consider this process as part of the translation process and not a check.


**Before you start**  You are translating a verse in Paratext 9, and you want to see what renderings you have already chosen for the terms in the current verse, and then make sure they are consistent with other verses.


**Why this is important**  For your readers to understand your text, you need to be consistent in your use of terms. It is a big task to make them completely consistent. If you start from the verse you are translating and work from there the task is more manageable. The goal is to have consistently rendered Biblical Terms and well-documented decisions on why you made the changes.


**What you are going to do**  This method boils down to a short list of steps:

1. **[A]** Find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
2. **[B]** Choose which rendering is/are best, and record why it is best.
3. **[C]** Document why you rejected the other renderings.
4. **[D]** Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation. (Make Consistent, Standardise, Normalise, Harmonise).
- Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.
- You will also use the new Paratext 9.4 feature to export terms from the Biblical terms list and share it with your colleagues.

## 10.1 Open the Biblical terms rending window {#f8f57567e6ff4b9193367abfbee7302a}

1. Click in your project
2. **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** &gt; **Biblical terms rendering**
3. **≡ Tab** (of the new window), under **Biblical Terms** &gt; **Select Biblical terms list**
4. Choose the desired list
5. Click **OK**.

## 10.2 A: Find all the ways you have rendered this term {#df4c8121b667426ca013ce2feace7348}


### Find the terms for the current verse {#3ffdc542c5f84c369b2c4cdfcc8569e1}

- Is there a tick/checkmark in the found column?
- If there is a tick/checkmark, your verse uses the term, and you can continue with the next term.
- If not, you need to either correct your text or add the new term you have used (see below).

### Add another rendering {#dae5da6bfb1b40c99e9eb4f0c7fe1f06}


If the term you have used is not on the list, you can add it:


<div class='notion-row'>
<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5)'}}>

1. Select the rendering of the term in your text.

2. Copy it (**Ctrl**+**C**)

3. Double-click in the renderings cell of the Biblical Terms rendering window.
    - _The edit renderings dialog is displayed_.

4. Paste (**Ctrl**+**V**) the rendering in the dialog box.

5. Click **OK**.

</div><div className='notion-spacer'></div>

<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5)'}}>

</div>

### Find other verses in the current book with the same Biblical term {#bbdc4762638048adb945ccfff0f3c9e3}


In the Biblical Terms rendering window


<div class='notion-row'>
<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5)'}}>

1. Double-click on a word in the **Term** column
    - _The Biblical Terms Tool opens_

2. From the second filter button choose **current book**

3. Add renderings for the term in the verses until you have identified the terms in all those verses  (see below).

</div><div className='notion-spacer'></div>

<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5)'}}>

</div><div className='notion-spacer'></div>
</div>

### Add renderings from the other verses {#a5212cc460da4fabb7cb3db81d405280}

1. Select the rendering in the verse
2. Add the rendering using **Ctrl**+**A**
3. Continue until you have identified the terms in all those verses.

### Dealing with verses that do not use the term {#3867de64e3064e85a08eed2cdab64dad}


:::tip

There are times when a verse is translated without using the actual term. For example, when you use a pronoun. In this case you need to deny that it is an error.

:::




<div class='notion-row'>
<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5)'}}>

- Click the red cross to the left of the verse reference link
    - _The red cross turns into a green tick with a small red x_

</div><div className='notion-spacer'></div>

<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5)'}}>

:::caution

If you click on the cross by mistake, click the green tick and it will return to the red cross.

3. Select, then Cut (**Ctrl**+**x**) and paste (**Ctrl**+**v**) it to the top of the dialogue box
4. Add ***** as necessary to combine similar renderings

:::tip

You can use ***** in a number of different ways: before the word for prefixes and after the word for suffixes. You can also put an ***** in the middle of a word. See the guide for more ways of using the *****.
