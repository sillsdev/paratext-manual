## **9.1 Introduction** {#238598a5fd40806a9aedf7a3c815e546}

Most languages do not have access to concordances and other Bible study resources in their own language. Adding cross-references to your New Testament can greatly help your reader understand the text by helping them find passages on similar themes.

_**Where are we now?**_

Before you can insert cross-references from a template text, your administrator must have created all the books (and chapters and verses) in your project. They can be empty, but they must be present.

_**Why is this feature important?**_

Reading the New Testament is not like reading a novel. Having access to cross-references allows your reader to find similar passages on related topics. However, adding cross-references one by one is too tedious. The **Insert Cross-References** menu allows you to insert all cross-references at once (book names and cross-reference punctuation will also be converted to match your **Bible reference settings**).

_**What are we going to do?**_

We are going to do three things:

If you don't have a template text with the desired cross-references, you can create your own list and import it.

## **9.2 Extract cross-references from a template text** {#238598a5fd408004ac30deb865764afa}

- Open the template project (e.g. another project in the branch).
- **≡ Tab** under **Project**, choose **Advanced** then **Extract Cross-References**
- Enter a file name

Note: Resources do not allow you to extract cross-references.

- **≡ Tab** under **Project**, choose **Project settings** &gt; **Bible reference settings**.
- Check that the following items have been set correctly for your project (change them if necessary).
- Punctuation in the **Reference format** tab.
- The abbreviations for books in the **Book Names** tab.
- ओके पर क्लिक करें

## **9.4 Check the language settings** {#238598a5fd40804fb819dc6cf9b4f04c}

- **≡ Tab** under **Project**, choose **Project Settings** &gt; select **Language Settings...**
- Click the **Other Characters** tab.
- In the **Verse Segments** field, enter at least six unique characters separated by spaces.
- ओके पर क्लिक करें

## **9.5 Insert cross-references** {#238598a5fd4080b9a7afeb1e417b182e}

- **≡ Tab** under **Project**, choose **Advanced**, then **Insert Cross-References**.
- Click **Browse...**.
- Navigate to the .xrf file containing extracted cross-references.
- Select the file, then click **Open**.
