**Introduction**  You use the Assignments and Progress to help organise your work and to see which tasks to do next. Once you have finished the task, you should mark it as completed so that you can report on what has been achieved. [If you have used an earlier version, you will see that it has dramatically improved in Paratext 9.]


**Before you start**  Before you can use the plan, it must have been configured. [This is usually done by your project administrator who will add the appropriate organisational plan and configure it for your team.]


**Why is this important?**  There are so many tasks to be done in a translation project. It is important to have a system to make sure these are all done. Now that your plan has been configured, you can use the plan to see what tasks have been assigned to you to be done next. When you finish the task, you can mark the task as completed and see the next task to do. You can use this information to generate reports for supervisors and donors (see [Project progress](https://manual.paratext.org/Training-Manual/Stage-1/PP2)).


**What are we going to do?**  You will mark a variety of tasks as complete. The exact steps will vary slightly depending on whether the task is set to once per project, once per book, or by chapter. The place to mark progress for all types of tasks is the Status column.
