**Introduction**  In this module, you will learn to do several other basic checks (**Characters**, **punctuation**, **capitals**, and **repeated words**. As in the first Basic Checks module (5. [Basic checks 1](https://sillsdev.github.io/paratext-manual/5.BC1)), it is easiest to run these checks from the Assignments and Progress. However, if you want to check several books, you will need to use the **Verification** menu.


**Before you start**  You have typed your translation in Paratext 9. Be sure that you have checked the chapter/verse numbers and markers, as described in 5. [Basic checks 1](https://sillsdev.github.io/paratext-manual/5.BC1), before continuing and that your administrator has either completed the setup of the checks or is with you to do the setup now.


**Why this is important?**  Paratext 9 has eleven **Basic Checks**. You have already seen the first two, chapter/verse numbers and markers. This module will help you to find errors linked to characters, punctuation, capital letters and repeated words. Even though these errors may not influence the content of the text, correcting them makes the text easier to read.


**What we are going to do:**  Most of the checks require that an inventory has been completed by your administrator. In this module you will

- Confirm that the setup has been done (or have the administrator do the setup)
- do the Basic Checks
- correct any errors.

## 12.1 Confirm the setup {#96b5c12dac164c719816a72af9b6bdea}


Before you can run these other basic checks some form of setup must be done. Some checks require an inventory others require rules or settings.


:::caution

You can do most of the inventories, but **only your Administrator** can do the rules or settings.

:::




## 12.2 Using inventories to setup {#2af0f49b3c8248368dd82611ad6daed7}


:::tip

These inventories show what is currently in your text, that is, both the good and the bad. You need to work through the inventory and tell Paratext 9 which elements are correct (valid) and which are errors (invalid).

:::




Once you have finished the inventory you will be ready to do the check.

1. From the **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** &gt; **Checking inventories** menu, choose the appropriate inventory (for example Character inventory).
1. Click on an item in the list in the top pane.
    - _The verses are shown in the bottom pane._
1. For each item in the top pane, choose either **Valid** or **Invalid**.
1. Repeat for each item.
1. Click **OK**.

:::tip

Instead of using the mouse, you can use **Ctrl** + **y** to mark an entry as **Valid** or **Ctrl** + **n** to mark an entry as **Invalid**.

:::

:::caution

It is possible to run all the checks at the same time, however when running the checks for the first time it is better to run them one at a time to avoid large list of errors.
