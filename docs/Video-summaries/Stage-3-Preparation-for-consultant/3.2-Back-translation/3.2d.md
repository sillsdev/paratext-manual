When a back translation has been marked as complete, and someone subsequently edits and saves the vernacular, the status of the affected verse is changed to outdated. It needs checking.


### If no change is needed {#728573b0f51c41da804e9fc60e241d82}

- Mark the verse as finished.

### To move between verses which need checking {#b7dfc0ff82ee42c997c3838171d195cb}

- Use the up and down arrow buttons at the top of the window.

### To see exactly what has changed in the translation {#feb2b8e3d95c40b89e2118e900e63169}

- Click the ‘**view differences**’ button
	- _The Compare Versions window opens_.

On the **left** is the **current** version, and on the **right** is **how it was** when the back translation was marked as finished. The differences between the versions are highlighted.


### Other icons {#b25097c0b0c646879391c77ce6796993}


**X** and **!** indicate a problem with the verse numbering.

- Hover the mouse over the status box to find out what the symbol means.
- If the problem is due to an error in the vernacular translation, edit the vernacular to correct the problem.
- Save it
	- _the checkmark reappears in the back translation_.
