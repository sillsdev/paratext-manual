When a back translation has been marked as complete, and someone subsequently edits and saves the vernacular, the status of the affected verse is changed to outdated. It needs checking.


### If no change is needed {#9db174d1cf964cc88731c1669f1ce9ae}

- Mark the verse as finished.

### To move between verses which need checking {#d26d3684a46e4a6990295d069763dbd3}

- Use the up and down arrow buttons at the top of the window.

### To see exactly what has changed in the translation {#cd598906eae149e48a4dd02c4b974cf8}

- Click the ‘**view differences**’ button
	- _The Compare Versions window opens_.

On the **left** is the **current** version, and on the **right** is **how it was** when the back translation was marked as finished. The differences between the versions are highlighted.


### Other icons {#e073ee7d7e0f4506a819035e19d50114}


**X** and **!** indicate a problem with the verse numbering.

1. Hover the mouse over the status box to find out what the symbol means.
	- If the problem is due to an error in the vernacular translation, edit the vernacular to correct the problem.
1. Save it
	- _the checkmark reappears in the back translation_.
