When a back translation has been marked as complete, and someone subsequently edits and saves the vernacular, the status of the affected verse is changed to outdated. It needs checking.


### If no change is needed[](https://manual.paratext.org/Video-summaries/Stage-3/3.2-Back-translation/3.2d#if-no-change-is-needed) {#b7d7f522aef84f64a12acddb4d598925}

- Mark the verse as finished.

### To move between verses which need checking[](https://manual.paratext.org/Video-summaries/Stage-3/3.2-Back-translation/3.2d#to-move-between-verses-which-need-checking) {#0787fe1624ca4bf0800e9ea49aba4e41}

- Use the up and down arrow buttons at the top of the window.

### To see exactly what has changed in the translation[](https://manual.paratext.org/Video-summaries/Stage-3/3.2-Back-translation/3.2d#to-see-exactly-what-has-changed-in-the-translation) {#00e8007773bd4fb59cadbfacbb3a318e}

- Click the ‘**view differences**’ button
	- _The Compare Versions window opens_.

On the **left** is the **current** version, and on the **right** is **how it was** when the back translation was marked as finished. The differences between the versions are highlighted.

**X** and **!** indicate a problem with the verse numbering.

1. Hover the mouse over the status box to find out what the symbol means.
	- If the problem is due to an error in the vernacular translation, edit the vernacular to correct the problem.
1. Save it
	- _the checkmark reappears in the back translation_.
