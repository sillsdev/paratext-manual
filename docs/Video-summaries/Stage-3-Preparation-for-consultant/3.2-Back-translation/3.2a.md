A back translation is a way to check a translation. In Bible translation, the vernacular text is translated into a major language so that a translation consultant who is not fluent in the vernacular can examine the translation and help the team improve it. In Paratext, a back translation is done in a separate but linked project.


### What are the qualities of a good back translation? {#0e479e2fa2e9412c80d62bd49c917e53}

- Done by someone not involved in drafting the vernacular translation.
- Natural, and reflect how the back translator understands the sense of the vernacular text.
- Without using any helps or other Bibles.
- Reflect what the vernacular text says and not what it should say.
