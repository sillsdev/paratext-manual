### Guess renderings {#67d085acdd984b55a3848d2bf4c78bf0}


The guess renderings feature uses statistics to guess which words in the translation are probably the rendering of which Biblical Term. It can be quite accurate at guessing proper names.

- Open the menu for the **Biblical Terms** window.
- Under Tools, click **Guess Renderings**.
	- _The Guess Renderings dialog box opens. By default, it already has the Name category selected_.
- Optionally, you can use a model text.
- Click **OK**.
	- _Paratext analyzes the texts and makes guesses of_ _**all**_ _names in the project_.
	- _When it finishes, it informs us that all the guessed renderings are highlighted in orange_.
- Click [**OK**] to dismiss the message.

### Approve guessed renderings {#074f58b380f4458fad3a816d2351ee71}


Renderings with an orange background are guessed, approved renderings have a white background. Guessed renderings should be reviewed and approved or corrected by a member of the team.


### Approve renderings one at a time {#c12ca262d39549a68db044ff1e2a8aff}

- Double clicking the renderings to open the Edit Renderings box.

After you approve a large number of renderings, it is helpful to mark those words as correctly spelled.

- Open the **menu** for the Biblical Terms window.
- Under **Tools**, click **Mark Renderings as Correctly Spelled**.
