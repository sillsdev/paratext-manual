In this video we are going to look at some additional ways that the Biblical Terms Tool can help us achieve a consistent translation.


**Set the verse filter**

- Click the verses filter and select “**Choose**”.
	- _The Choose dialog box opens._
- Click the Books tab.
- Click New Testament.
	- _All the books in the New Testament are now selected._
- Click [**OK**].

**Find a biblical term**

- Click in the Find box.
- Type the text to find.

**To correct a typo**

- Click on the term
- Click the **Edit** hyperlink.
- Edit the text in this small window.
- Click **OK** to save the changes.
	- _Paratext now recognises the rendering_.

**Approve a wording even though different**

- Click on the **red X**.
	- _This tells Paratext that the wording is appropriate in this context even though there is not a specific, explicit rendering_.

**Add a note to remind to discuss**

- Double click the first column next to the term.
	- _A note window opens_
- Type the note…
- Click [**OK**].

**Add another rendering**

- Select the text
- Click **Add Rendering**.
	- _The new rendering is added to the row in the Biblical Terms table_.

**Change a synonym**


For consistency’s sake we should change it.

- Click the **Edit** hyperlink.
- Change the word.
- Click **OK**.

**Found column**


When all occurrences of the biblical term have an identified rendering a tick is shown in the found column.


When the symbol in the Found column includes a tiny **X** it is to remind us that one of the renderings is a permitted omission of a rendering.
