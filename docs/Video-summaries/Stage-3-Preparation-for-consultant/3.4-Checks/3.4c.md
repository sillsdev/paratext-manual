The Quoted Text check has nothing to do with quotes in the text marked with quotation marks.


Rather, this check verifies that any text marked as quoted in a footnote (\fq) or cross reference (\fx) or keyword (\fk) matches the text in the verse.


## Adding \fq, \fx {#2aade154bbdc435b95b35bad242827ba}

- Select text (in the verse)
- Insert a footnote (Ctrl+Shift+N)
	- _The text is copied into the footnote with the quoted text markers_.

A **discrepancy** will arise if the verse text is edited **after** the text is quoted in the footnote, and no one remembers to **update** the footnote.


## Run check from Assignments and Progress dialog {#6e149f4383df4449adeea3f982dd0161}

- Open the Assignments and Progress dialogue (blue button),

	- _Paratext opens a panel showing the issues_.
