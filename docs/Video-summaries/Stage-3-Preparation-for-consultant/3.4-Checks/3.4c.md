The Quoted Text check has nothing to do with quotes in the text marked with quotation marks.


Rather, this check verifies that any text marked as quoted in a footnote (\fq) or cross-reference (\fx) or keyword (\fk) matches the text in the verse.


### Adding \fq, \fx {#36075c77e5e5417784f41321c2c075c1}

1. Select text (in the verse)
1. Insert a footnote (Ctrl+Shift+N)
	- _The text is copied into the footnote with the quoted text markers_.

A **discrepancy** will arise if the verse text is edited **after** the text is quoted in the footnote, and no one remembers to **update** the footnote.
