The reference in a parallel passage heading or a cross reference has an icon beside it. When you click on the icon, Paratext opens a Quick Reference window to that passage.


### Problem with reference {#d1f44887d1d340ac899fb7e22a74f4a5}


If there is a problem with the reference, the icon has a **red X** on it.


By hovering over the red X, you can see a description of the problem.

### Common errors {#3af70607d18548219ef2c6cd47d6a21a}


You might need to refer to the project’s **Scripture Reference Settings** to see what is valid for your project so you can correct the errors.

- **Invalid chapter/verse separator**
	- The separator is often either a period (full stop) or a colon between the chapter number and the verse number.
	- Correct the character.
		- _When Paratext recognizes that the error is fixed, the_ _**red x**_ _on the icon goes away_.
- **Invalid verse separator**
	- The separator is usually either comma (with or without a space).
	- For a **range of verses**, use the range of verses separator, which, is usually a hyphen.
- **Invalid book**
	- In the book names tab, you set three names for each book: the long name, the short name, and an abbreviation.
		- Set the names to be used for \xt field and parallel references.
		- Edit the book name.
			- _The error goes away_.
- **Invalid verse separator**
	- Errors for this problem can be harder to see.
	- Check the separator character and any spaces.

### Other Possible Errors {#3a8f5f2c2713435e91cf06b61554e936}

- Paratext only checks for references in \r, \ior, \x, \xo, \xt, \fr.
- Other markers are not checked. A way to spot that a marker isn’t being checked is to notice when the reference icon is **missing**.
