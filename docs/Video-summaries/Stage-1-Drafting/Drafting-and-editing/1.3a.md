In this video we will learn how to view more than one chapter at a time in a Paratext window. When we open a project or resource in Paratext, by default it only shows us the current chapter.

- Click the **≡ menu** button for the project.
- Click the expand arrow to view Full menus.
- Under View, click **“Show all chapters”**.
	- _Paratext loads the entire book into the Window_.
- (Checked = by chapter, unchecked = by book)

:::tip


We recommend that you leave 'View By Chapter' checked most of the time as it can slow Paratext down when it updates the book.
