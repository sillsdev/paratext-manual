This video was created in Paratext 8 but applies equally to Paratext 9. In this video we learn there are a few places where you must insert a paragraph marker. 


:::


At a minimum, Paratext needs a paragraph at the beginning of each chapter.


In **standard view**

- Click where you want to put the paragraph,
- press **ENTER**, and then select the paragraph marker from the list.

### Add after section headings markers {#00b6bf1a8f7144f9a0397326581a2d97}


\s1, \s2, \s3 \s4


Be sure to add another paragraph marker after the heading.


### Add after Parallel reference headings {#550ecd0a955e40978682890a68264407}


\r


Be sure to add another paragraph marker after the reference heading.


:::tip 


Remember,

- you **always** need a paragraph marker **before verse 1** of any chapter.
- you **always** need a paragraph **after** any **section head \sâ€¦** or **parallel passage heading \r**.

### Other common markers {#202f0aed51604f81888a1018ef82ccbb}

- \p standard paragraph
- \m for a paragraph with no first line indent,

- \q1 or \q2 for indented quotes or poetry.
