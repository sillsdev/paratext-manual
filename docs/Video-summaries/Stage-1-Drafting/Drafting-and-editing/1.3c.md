This video was created in Paratext 8 but applies equally to Paratext 9. In this video we learn there are a few places where you must insert a paragraph marker. 


:::


At a minimum, Paratext needs a paragraph at the beginning of each chapter.


In **standard view**

1. Click where you want to put the paragraph,
1. press **ENTER**, and then select the paragraph marker from the list.

### Add after section headings markers {#0f82a711442e4a0399f8de7f48e94794}


\s1, \s2, \s3 \s4


Be sure to add another paragraph marker after the heading.


### Add after Parallel reference headings {#2c3daba7a9f2439bb37885bc10bb1086}


\r


Be sure to add another paragraph marker after the reference heading.


:::tip 


Remember,

1. you **always** need a paragraph marker **before verse 1** of any chapter.
1. you **always** need a paragraph **after** any **section head \sâ€¦** or **parallel passage heading \r**.
