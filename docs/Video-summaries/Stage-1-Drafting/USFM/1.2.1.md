In this video you learn all about how Paratext uses special tags called USFMs. The tags

- provide the structure of the document by identifying the start of each book, as well as the sections within them.
- help you navigate around the translation using Bible references.
- facilitate the appropriate formatting of the translation by the typesetter according to what each bit of text really is, such as a heading, chapter number, or something special in the Bible text itself such as poetry or a quotation.

USFM stands for **U**nified **S**tandard **F**ormat **M**arker.


USFMs always start with a **backslash**, then a **code**, then a **space**. (e.g. \ft )


With the exception of a closing marker which ends with an asterisk and doesn’t need a space.

- The most common USFMs are:
\p (paragraph)
\c (chapter)
\v (verse)
