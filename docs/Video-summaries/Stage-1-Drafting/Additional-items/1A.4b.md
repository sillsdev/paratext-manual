Like editing other books in Paratext, it is necessary for a user to have the relevant task assignments or user permissions in order to add renderings to the glossary or to edit the glossary book directly.


### Can you type in the citation form? {#53722f63aa5a4a7b8cf352ea73cb5993}

### Contact your administrator {#48e958449c43426aa85bb968d6e5cab9}
