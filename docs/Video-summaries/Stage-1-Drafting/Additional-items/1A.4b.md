Like editing other books in Paratext, it is necessary for a user to have the relevant task assignments or user permissions in order to add renderings to the glossary or to edit the glossary book directly.


### Can you type in the citation form? {#01c37d5527b54cab84d75ec1e3d3a844}

- Does the Titlebar of Edit Renderings dialog box says “**Not Editable**”

### Contact your administrator {#9f716744c77748f1abbc6501d41e5fe8}

- Your administrator can give you the necessary permission if appropriate.
