There are three ways to find out if a term already has an entry in the glossary or not.


### Filter for “Glossary Entries”[](https://manual.paratext.org/Video-summaries/Stage-1/Additional/1A.4c#filter-for-glossary-entries) {#84f71c18292f420a89777f6f4fc91eb7}

- Change the filter from “All terms” to “Glossary Entries”.
	- _Paratext will now only list the Biblical terms that do have a glossary entry_.

### An asterisk = it has glossary entry for the current term[](https://manual.paratext.org/Video-summaries/Stage-1/Additional/1A.4c#an-asterisk--it-has-glossary-entry-for-the-current-term) {#ded5ec22a966454197405911d936afb0}
