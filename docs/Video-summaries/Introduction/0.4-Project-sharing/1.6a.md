## What is a Conflict {#886594b731c84dbfbb64b2f40e4d9358}


A **conflict** occurs when two or more people **edit the text at the same time**. Paratext gets confused and does not know which one to keep. It chooses one and adds a conflict note.


It is best to have **only one translator edit a text** at a time. Other team members should **add notes** of their suggestions.
