Scroll groups allow you to look up a different reference without having all the windows scroll to the new reference,


Paratext allows up to five different scroll groups, A through E. In addition, we can choose “none.”


The small dropdown control which contains the letter A is how we control the scroll groups.

When you open a new window, it will be in the same scroll group as the last active one.
