Paratext allows you to view several projects or resources at the same time.


Each project or resource is shown in a window, with its own title bar and menu. Projects can be editable but resources are never editable.

- Click the **main Paratext menu ≡**, and then click **Open**._The Open Project/Resource dialog box appears_.
