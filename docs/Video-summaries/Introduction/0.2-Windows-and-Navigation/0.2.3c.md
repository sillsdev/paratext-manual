You can change which text a window displays. This is a way of opening a different text instead of one of your open ones, leaving your window layout the same.

1. On the toolbar, click the project list.

1. Select the text you wish to display.
	- _The window now shows the new version instead and the window layout remains the same_.

NOTE


:::note

At this time, you can only open another similar resource in the window using the project list (i.e Project, Enhance Resource, Biblical terms).

TIP


:::tip

Remember if the saved layout contains the other version, it will be re-opened if you use the saved layout again. If the **current text** selection is what you want to use in future, **re-save the layout** as it currently is.
