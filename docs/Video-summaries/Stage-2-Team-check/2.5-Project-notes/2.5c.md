In this video, we will learn how to view what has changed in the verse since the note was created, and how to resolve a note when the to-do item has been taken care of.


**See what has changed since the note was originally inserted.**

- Click the multi-coloured button which includes the strikethrough and underline.
	- _This button turns a special comparison pane on and off_.

**Change display style**

- Click the button next to the Show Changes button, to change the view

There are three possible views,


The first view (the default)

- **new text** is shown with a **green** background and
- **deleted text** is shown with a **red** background.

The second view

- **added** text with **underlines** and
- **deleted** text with **strikethrough**,

The third view

- **added** text with **underlines** and
- **deleted** text **superscripted**.

**Resolve notes (mark as complete)**


When a note is completed, you resolve the note.

- Click the **Resolve** button.
	- _The note icon is removed from the scripture view, although the note is still stored in the project and can be viewed again if needed_.
