### PTXPrint {#ff906550e403455c865ad94b6b826cf6}


PTXPrint is a separate program which similarly creates a PDF file from a Paratext project. It has far more configuration options, such as

- more precise picture placement,
- fine-grained control of footnotes,
- headings, and
- columns.
- It can print diglots and include page borders.
