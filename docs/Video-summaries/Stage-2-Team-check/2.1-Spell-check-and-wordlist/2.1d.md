In this video we looked at some features of the Wordlist tool that we didn’t cover or only covered in passing in the other videos on spell checking.

- Wordlist tool is the key tool for spell checking in Paratext.
- It is an inventory of all the words in your project and their spelling status.

### Open the Wordlist {#31b6cc39ce084a4084cda5ea28ebf300}

- On the project’s menu under **Tools**.
- **OR** (quicker) right click on any word in the scripture text, and select **Wordlist**.
	- _This opens the Wordlist tool with that word selected_.

		:::tip
		
		You can use the right click option even when the wordlist tool is already open.

### Filters {#5ef4e52f2e844998b704163b817c59ce}


Across the top of the Wordlist window are various filters.

- In the Words filter, you can filter by spelling status.
- The Verses filter allows you to reduce the range of scripture text the words are drawn from.

**To turn off a filter**

- Choose the most broad option in the filter list.

**Using the Find Word filter text box**

- You can search in the words themselves.
- Type a word or part of word
	- _There is no need to press Enter; the search happens straight away_.

### Change the spelling status of the words {#262693b702964d2fb52a369d98dbdb0f}


The tool works in the same way, verifying replacements and saving corrections. If you change your mind on a selected status, or realise you have made a mistake, you can always set it back to Undecided in addition to choosing Correct or Incorrect.


### To turn off the Find filter {#15cc6f2a659c4919a615d06dea0ae9c2}

### How to delete a wrong saved correction {#9171462ef0c449dcb552ee4b66d4f022}


**If actually correct**


If a word is marked as incorrect with a saved correction, and the word is actually spelled correctly

- Click **Correct**.
	- _The saved correction is removed_.

**If it is actually incorrect**


If on the other hand the word is spelled incorrectly, but you accidentally selected the wrong correction,

- Click the **x** again, even though it is already the selected status.
	- _Paratext gives you a fresh opportunity to enter or select the right correction_.

### Capitalisation {#118debe6197e4636b9624e51a6c8db2f}


Paratext takes sentence position into account when analysing words and only lists words which are probably proper nouns with their capital letters.
