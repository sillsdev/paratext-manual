### Red squiggles {#d9774a216891453ebba57d02499fb7a8}


A red squiggle is displayed on words which are incorrect or which Paratext calculates are probably incorrect.


### Grey squiggles {#c988306910cc4618883a5d7193fbb36e}


Grey indicates that Paratext doesn’t know anything about the spelling status and can’t work out if it is suspicious.

- _These words are all undecided_.

### Record the correct spelling {#7aeb88ebee1a444bb60837adf18dfed6}


If a spelling is wrong, it is helpful to have Paratext record what the correction is.
