The Parallel Passages tool displays and aligns very similar passages from different books, such as the same event being recounted repeatedly in the gospels. The tool enables you to check you have translated these passages with wording that is suitably similar or different, in accordance with the original texts. Knowledge of which passages are similar to each other is built into Paratext. Paratext calls these parallel passages.
