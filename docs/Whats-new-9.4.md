(taken from [https://paratext.org/features/whats-new/whats-new-in-paratext-9-4-beta/](https://paratext.org/features/whats-new/whats-new-in-paratext-9-4-beta/))


**Some Highlights**

- **Notification of updates for projects on the user’s computer:** Now, Paratext can check whether the projects on one’s computer have been updated on the Send-Receive server. If the project has been edited, users will be notified with a green dot in both the main and project menus (see image below). Settings for checking for updates are available in the **Send/Receive projects** window.

- **Notification of updates for installed resources.** A green dot in the main menu can also indicate updates to resource texts on the local computer. Access to the settings for this feature is in the **Download/Install resources** window.
- **Improved Right-to-Left interface.** Paratext now correctly displays right-to-left user interfaces (like Arabic). [RTL video demo](https://paratext.org/features/whats-new/whats-new-in-paratext-9-4-beta/?vimeography_gallery=157&vimeography_video=858761461)

- **Option to hide project notes.** Numerous red flags in the text can easily become an obstacle to reading. Users can now choose to hide or display project note flags in the text. Access from the **View menu &gt; Show Project Notes**.
