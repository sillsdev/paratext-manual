## **3.1 Introduction** {#238598a5fd4080cb9c9de2f4e5c2ef1e}


From Paratext 8 onwards, it is mandatory for projects to share their basic information or metadata with the translation community. Sharing information on progress is strongly encouraged. [Some organisations and/or funders may require this.]


_**Where are we**_


Paratext 8 is already installed and you have the Paratext 7 registration codes for users.


_**Why is this skill important?**_


In Paratext 8, both users and projects must be registered. Access to specific text resources, such as the Word of Life, is determined by the organisation you belong to.


Projects can be registered by the administrator (or an advisor acting as administrator).


Other organisations/users are notified of your actions and may object to the BoG (Board of Governors). Basic information about the project metadata is available to all members of the Paratext community.


If your project is not registered, you will not have access to

- the interlinear generator.
- send/receive via the Internet.
- statistical glossing tools (suggest translations/equivalents).
- print the draft.

_**What are you going to do?**_

- You are going to register a Paratext 9 user
- You will register a new Paratext 9 project
- You will see the information that a registered project displays in the Paratext Register

## **3.2 Register with a Google account** {#238598a5fd4080c68c4ffa43e60d77be}

- Go to [https://registry.paratext.org](https://registry.paratext.org/)

The ‘Sign in’ screen will appear.

- Enter your email address

(Your address will be verified)

- Log in using your email address (Gmail)

A new screen will appear asking for your password.

- Enter your Google password
- Click **Yes** to allow Paratext to use your profile.

New Paratext 9 User will appear and you can fill in the form.


If you do not have a Gmail address, see section 3.4


### **3.3 Fill in the form** {#238598a5fd408058a72ac0e240c83306}

- Choose one of the three user options (new, already Paratext 7, already Paratext 8)
- If you are a Paratext 7 user, provide your Paratext 7 registration code
- Choose your organisation (or leave the field blank)

Anyone can register to use Paratext, but people who are not members of a translation organisation and who are not members of a registered project will not be able to use all of Paratext's features and will only have access to some resources.

- Select your **country**
- If applicable, enter your affiliate (entity in the field) and your supervisor
- Explain why you want to use Paratext.
- Tick (or leave unticked) the box to receive announcements.
- Click on **Register**

You will receive your registration code (also by email).


Keep this email or the code displayed here in a safe place, because if you lose it, there is no way to retrieve it. (This is a security feature; user codes are not stored on the server so that they cannot be stolen if someone attacks the server.)


## **3.4 Registering without a Google account** {#238598a5fd408096b664fb42d5b527f5}

- If your email account is not on a Google server, or if you choose not to use Google for authentication, the registration server will ask you to enter a password.
- Enter the password you want to set
- Enter the password again to confirm

The server will send an email to your account with a verification link.

- Open your email, go to the link, and proceed with the Paratext registration (see 3.3).

## **3.5 Change (generate) a new code** {#238598a5fd4080929a65c0bf5bdf5308}


There are various reasons why you may need to change your Paratext code in the future. One of the most common reasons is theft or failure of your computer.


**3.5.1 Change your own code**

- Go to the registration site [https://registry.paratext.org](https://registry.paratext.org/).
- Log in (if you are not already logged in).
- Click on the username at the top left.

A menu will appear.

- Click on **Settings**.
- Under Paratext, click on ‘**Registration**’.

The registration details screen will appear.

- Click on the Generate button to generate a new code.
- _The code will be sent to your email address._
- Launch Paratext.

If it connects to the Internet, it will detect that the old code is no longer valid and will ask you to update your registration information.

- Go to your email and copy the new code.
- Return to Paratext

Paratext may have already found your new code.

- If not, paste the new code into the registration form and click OK.

You are now re-registered.


You will need to do this on any other computer where your Paratext code is installed.

- If Paratext does not report a code change, you can do so as follows
- **≡ Tab**, under &gt; **Help** &gt; **Registration Information** and paste the code there.

### **3.5.2 Changing a code for a user**  {#238598a5fd4080a68785d14ffcc4832c}


**(whom** _**you**_ **have registered)**

- Go to the registration site [https://registry.paratext.org](https://registry.paratext.org/)
- Log in (if you are not already logged in)
- Click on User
- Click on the user name in the list
- Click on the down arrow (to the right of View)
- Select **Generate code**

A message will appear.

- Click on **Proceed**
- Check your email.

## **3.6 Register a user (without an email address)** {#238598a5fd408015a37cf2ede7ea2e0e}


Any administrator of a registered project can create new user registrations if they need to add people to their project. These users do not need to have an email address.

- Go to [https://registry.paratext.org](https://registry.paratext.org/)
- Log in using your email address
- Click on **Users**
- Click **+Register New User**

The New Paratext 9 User dialogue box appears.

- Fill in the form with their name, etc.

A user added by someone else cannot be a project administrator or advisor. If you want to make someone an advisor or administrator, they must register for Paratext themselves, and then you can add their name to the project.

- Click on **Create**

The registration code for the new user will be sent by email to the administrator after approval.


Keep this code safe, as it cannot be recovered if lost. However, you can generate a new code, see 3.5


## **3.7 If the translation project is not part of a recognised organisation** {#238598a5fd4080e1b057eaebd217d878}

- If a translator is not part of a recognised organisation, a request can be made to BoG ([boardofgovernors@paratext.org](mailto:boardofgovernors@paratext.org)) to become a member of the pseudo-organisation ‘Independent Translators’.

Only a few resource text owners may grant access to this group.
