Things to consider:


_**This is a dynamic process**_

- When a project is brand new, there aren't many settings that can be fixed.
- As the project matures, some of the inventories start to make sense.

_**Who is working on the project**_

- Set up users, roles, and permissions
- Would it be useful to have a ‘simplified menu’?

_**Do you need to customise the settings?**_

- custom.sty
- change the style sheet settings
- the names of markers (in other languages)
- the colour to help identify features?
- custom.vrs
- identify verses that are different from the default versification

_**What spelling will be used?**_

- Place the spelling letters in the language settings.
- (Remember that what you put in the language settings could go into the ‘Speech and Language Data Repository’.)

_**How will characters be entered?**_

- Keyman/MSKLC (Keyman is free!)
- AutoCorrect.txt

_**Which quotation system will be used?**_

- Define quotation rules [Dynamic]
- Think about your rules
- Test what you have chosen
- Adjust rules
- Make corrections to rules/text if necessary

_**When you have text data**_

- Start with inventories
- Start at the beginning [characters]
- Look for options in the inventories!
- Is the element valid all the time? Or just in certain situations?

_**Biblical reference settings**_

- Which book names do you use?
- What is the format of a reference?
- Where to place the origin of notes? [First, last...]
