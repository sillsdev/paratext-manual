# **CV: Convert a Project** {#238598a5fd4080aa8ca3d773eab1eca5}


**8.1 Introduction**


If you ever need to rename your project, reduce its size, change user names, change the encoding, or struggle with compound/decompound diacritics, the **Convert Project** tool will help you solve these problems.


_**Where are we?**_


You must be the project administrator to make these conversions.


_**Why is this skill important?**_


Only a few changes can be made to the project in the project's **Properties and settings**. Major changes require a new project to be created. The **Convert project** tool allows the new project to retain the project history.


_**What are we going to do?**_


We will work through the six changes that can be made to your project.

- Change the short name of the project
- Remove deleted files from the project history
- Clear the Paratext Live history
- Convert the encoding to 65001 — Unicode [UTF8]
- Normalisation — compound or decomposed
- Replace old user names

## **8.2 The ‘Convert Project’ dialogue box** {#238598a5fd4080caa41df545077c6949}

- **Tab** under **Tools**, select **Advanced**, then **Convert Project**

### **8.2.1 Change the short name of the project** {#238598a5fd40804fab07c9e96a03d3e3}

- Confirm that the old project name is correct. [If not, close the dialogue box, click on the correct project window and go to the New dialogue box.]
- Enter the new short name for the project in **[1]**.

### **8.2.2 Scan for deleted files in project history** {#238598a5fd4080558d85d375865a60b9}

- **[2]** Select this option if you have deleted files [such as large illustrations] that you no longer want to be part of the project history.

### **8.2.3 Clean up Paratext Live history** {#238598a5fd40805eadb1e31066da98e3}

- **[3]** Select this option if you have edited the project with Paratext Live and want to replace the names in the project history.

### **8.2.4 Convert encoding to 65001 — Unicode [UTF8]** {#238598a5fd408074b0f8d3485d39832d}

- **[4]** Select this option to convert a standard Unicode encoding project.

> This will not work to change the encoding if your project contains a ‘pirated font’. Normalisation – composed or decomposed.


### **8.2.5 Normalisation** {#238598a5fd408022a4cdfa3928de338b}

- **[5]** Select Compound [NFC] or one of the options in the drop-down list if the data in your project contains a mixture of compound and decomposed characters.

### **8.2.6 Replacing old user names** {#238598a5fd4080a29338d87b3b6f865e}

- **[6]** Select the name of the user you want to replace from the drop-down list.
- **[7]** Type the name of a registered Paratext user in this box.
- **[8]** Click **Add**,
	- _a summary of the replacement is displayed with a ‘Remove’ button._
- [If you make a mistake when typing the name in the **With** field or decide not to make the replacement, click **Remove**].

## **8.3 Converting a project** {#238598a5fd4080c5af98e42c78124f28}

- [9] Click **OK** to convert the project.
