**Introduction**
This module explains how to add entries to the glossary using the Biblical terms tool.


**Where we are**
You have drafted and entered your text in Paratext 9. Now you will add some glossary entries to explain some of the terms.


**Why this is important**
It is good to have a list of important words and their explanations so that the readers can understand the text well. Rather than typing directly into the glossary, it is better to use the Biblical terms tool as it keeps the Glossary in alphabetical order. The tool also keeps track of the changes to the glossary.


**What you are going to do**
You will use the Biblical terms tool to add a rendering for the term and then use the glossary tab to enter the citation form and the definition.


There are four training videos available on [adding](https://sillsdev.github.io/paratext-manual/1A.4a.md), [linking](https://sillsdev.github.io/paratext-manual/1A.4c.md) and [editing](https://sillsdev.github.io/paratext-manual/1A.4d.md) and getting [permission to edit](https://sillsdev.github.io/paratext-manual/1A.4b.md) glossaries. (P9 1A.4a-d).
