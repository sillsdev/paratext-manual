**Introduction**
In this module, you will find and correct formatting and layout errors.


**Where we are**
You have typed your draft into a project in Paratext. You will use the checklists to find and correct errors related to the formatting and layout errors.


**Why this is important**
A New Testament contains more than just chapters and verses. There are also titles, section headings, and several types of paragraphs. These checks allow you to be sure that the layout of your text is correct, and your titles etc. are consistent.


**What are you going to do?**
You will use the checklists to

- compare your titles and section headings
- check your paragraph breaks
- compare the paragraph markers in your text with those of your reference text
- add markers for special text formatting.
