**Introduction**
In this module, you will search for a word or phrase in a project and compare it with the translation of that word or phrase in another project.


**Why this is important?**
In Paratext 9 (and above), you can see where a word or phrase is found in one project and compare it with the equivalent word or phrase in one or more other projects. For example, you can see where "roi" is found in a French project and compare it with "rey" in a Spanish project.


**What will you do?**  


You will

- use the checklist “Word or Phrase” from both the text and also from the Biblical Terms Tool.
- change the settings and comparative texts
- type the word or phrase to compare for each project
