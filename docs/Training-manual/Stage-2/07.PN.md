**Introduction**
In this module, you will check that the proper names have been transliterated consistently. There are two ways to do this. One way is to have Paratext guess the proper names based on statistical analysis of a model text. The other way is to tell Paratext the changes for specific characters.


**Before you start**
You have (or are working on) the rules for transliterating the names.


**Why this is important**
You want to be consistent so that is clear who is being referred to in the text.


**What you are going to do**
You will:

- filter the Major Biblical terms list on Names.
- EITHER use the **Guess renderings** tool to guess the appropriate rendering of the names.
- OR use the **Adapt Names** tool to enter your transliteration rules for each letter.
- edit and approve the individual names.
- add the approved names as proposed names in the Biblical terms list.
- work through the Biblical Terms list to ensure that all the verses are consistent.

## 7.2 Guess Renderings for proper nouns {#76994382a314443b8d87a674ff62edfa}

1. **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** &gt; **Guess renderings**
1. Click **OK**
	- _Paratext will add renderings to any terms which do not have a rendering (with an orange background)_
1. You will need to approve these renderings (see 7.4)

## 7.3 Adapt names {#b58d487994a74eadb24e7b897c04989d}


Adapting names should be done in the early stages of a translation project, before you have approved renderings of proper names. Otherwise you can use the guess renderings (see above).

1. **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** &gt; **Adapt Names**
1. Choose the language of your reference text (e.g. English or français)
	- _The Name Adaptation dialogue is displayed_

		![](/notion_imgs/994539435.png)


**Enter the changes for the individual letters (or letter clusters)**

- In the left pane, fill in the “Adapted Character” column for the individual letters or letter clusters.

**Then revise and approve the Adapted Name**

1. Work through the **Adapted name** column in the right pane.
1. For each name, if the adapted name is incorrect, click on the name in the **Adapted Name** column,
1. Edit the name and click **OK**
1. Once the name is correct, click in the **Approved** column.
1. Click **OK**.

## 7.6 Dealing with verses that do not have the name translated {#1ea058cf48dc47349e89ecfa2c61f80f}


:::tip


There are times when a verse is correctly translated even though you have not used the name. For example, a pronoun is used instead of the name. In this case you need to tell Paratext 9 that it is correct (that is, deny that the rendering is missing). 


:::

- Click the red cross at the left of the verse reference
	- _The cross turn into green tick (4a.Check) with a red cross_ .

<div class='notion-row'>
<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5)'}}>

- If you clicked on the red cross by mistake, click again on the icon

</div><div className='notion-spacer' />

<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5)'}}>
