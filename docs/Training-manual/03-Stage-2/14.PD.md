**Introduction**
In this module you will learn how to print a draft of your translation for checking and revising.


**Where we are**
You have entered and checked your translation in Paratext 9 and are now ready to print out a copy. Your project must be registered before you can print.


**Why this is important**
It is much easier to revise and check your work on paper than on the computer. You can also give it to more people if it is on paper.


**What you are going to do**
You will first produce a PDF version of your translation, which you can print or share with others (including non-Paratext users). If necessary, you can copy the PDF file onto your USB stick and take it to a computer with a printer.
