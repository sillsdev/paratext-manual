**Introduction**
The **Biblical terms rendering** window and the separate **Biblical terms** tool are very useful to make sure you are consistent in the use of terms, especially key terms. With many terms over many books this can become quite a task. This module explains a simple 4-step process to make your Biblical Terms consistent. This is a process should be considered part of the translation process and not a check.


**Where we are**
You are translating a verse in Paratext 9 and you want to see what renderings have already been chosen for the terms in the current verse and then make sure they are consistent with other verses.


**Why this is important**
For your readers to understand your text, you need to be consistent in your use of terms. It is a big task to make them completely consistent. If you start from the verse you are translating and work from there the task is more manageable. The goal is to have consistently rendered Biblical Terms and well documented decisions on why changes were made.


**What you are going to do**
This method boils down to a short list of steps:

1. **[A]** Find all the ways you have rendered this term, and enter them in the renderings dialog.
1. **[B]** Choose which rendering is/are best, and record why it is best.
1. **[C]** Document why you rejected the other renderings.
1. **[D]** Clean up your translation by making this rendering consistent throughout your translation. (Make Consistent, Standardise, Normalise, Harmonise).
- Repeat with next Biblical Term you find in the Biblical Terms Renderings window.

### 10.1 Open the Biblical terms rending window {#2a8f96d970e54f93b98e3c1dfd5b734c}

1. Click in your project
1. **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** &gt; **Biblical terms rendering**
1. **≡ Tab** (of the new window), under **Biblical Terms** &gt; **Select Biblical terms list**
1. Choose the desired list
1. Click **OK**.

### 10.2 A: Find all the ways you have rendered this term {#c495e6ed3e9e46c3b5c7fedd457e2712}


**Find the terms for the current verse**

- Is there a tick in the found column?
- If there is a tick, your verse uses the term and you can continue with the next term.
- If not, you need to either correct your text or add the new term you have used (see below).

**Add another rendering**


If the term you have used needs to be added to the list:

1. Select the rendering of the term in your text.
1. Copy it (**Ctrl**+**C**)
1. Double-click in the renderings cell.

	![](/notion_imgs/1087213700.png)

	- _The edit renderings dialog is displayed_.

		![](/notion_imgs/305292679.png)

- Paste (**Ctrl**+**V**) the rendering in the dialog box.
- Click **OK**.

**Find other verses in the current book with the same Biblical term**

- Double-click on a word in the **Term** column
	- _The Biblical Terms Tool opens_
- From the second filter button choose **current book**

	![](/notion_imgs/603221324.png)

- Add renderings for the term from the verses until the terms in all verses are been identified (see below).

**Add renderings from the other verses**

1. Select the rendering in the verse
1. Add the rendering using **Ctrl**+**A**
1. Continue until all terms for those verses have been identified.

**Dealing with verses that do not use the term**


:::tip


There are times when a verse is translated without using the actual term. For example, when a pronoun is used. In this case you need to deny that it is an error. 


:::


<div class='notion-row'>
<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 2)) * 1.375)'}}>

- Click the red cross  to the left of the verse reference link. The red cross turns into a green tick with a small red x

</div><div className='notion-spacer' />

<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 2)) * 0.08333333333333334)'}}>

	![](/notion_imgs/888808021.png)
