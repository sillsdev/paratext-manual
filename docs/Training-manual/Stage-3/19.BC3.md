**Introduction**
In this module you will learn how to run the remaining basic checks (references, quoted text, numbers, punctuation in pairs and quotations). As in the first two basic checks modules, it is easier to run the checks from the project plan. However, if you want to check more than one book then you need to run the checks from the checking menu.


**Before you start**
You have typed your translation into Paratext. Make sure you have done the checks described in modules [BC1](https://sillsdev.github.io/paratext-manual/5.BC1) and [BC2](https://sillsdev.github.io/paratext-manual/12.BC2) before continuing. And that either your administrator has done the setup for the checks or is available to do the setup with you.


**Why this is important**
Paratext has eleven basic checks. You have already seen the first six checks. This last set of checks helps you find errors related to material referred from other books. You want to be sure the references are accurate so that the reader can find those passages.


**What you are going to do**
As before, most of the checks require some setup to be done by your administrator. In this module you will:

- Confirm that the setup has been done
- Run the basic check
- Correct any errors.

## 19.1 Unmatched pairs of Punctuation {#37c2805933944d69852bddc3b8b8c520}


:::tip

This check looks at punctuation that occurs in pairs (opening and closing) and lists errors where it is not matched by the other half of the pair. This may be deliberate but is more likely to be an error, e.g. ( ), [ ], etc."
