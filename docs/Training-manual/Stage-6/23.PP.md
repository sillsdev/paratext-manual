**Introduction**
There are thousands of passages in the NT where either the same event is being described or where another verse is being quoted from the Old or New Testament. These verses need to be compared to make sure they are consistent.


**Where we are**
Normally you will have translated and checked the text of both books with a consultant first before comparing the texts. Though there are times that you will want to compare the other verses before you translate the second passage.


**Why this is important**
The parallel passages need to be consistent but they do not always need to be exactly the same. The Parallel Passages tool displays the various passages and highlights the text which is the same. But it is the meaning (not necessarily the form) that is important.


Normally you would make the comparisons after you have translated the passage because you don’t want to be influenced by what could be a bad earlier translation. But there are times when you will want to be able to see a second passage while you are translating.


**What you are going to do**

- use the Parallel Passages tool to compare the verses.
- use the check boxes to tell Paratext that you have checked the passages
- filter for any changed verses
- open a quick reference window in Paratext to see another passage while you are translating.
- open a third passage in a window.

Text is shown in **grey** in a project (or **green** in source texts) when the text is exactly the same as in the other passage.
Text is shown in **yellow** (in source texts) when it has the same meaning (or thought) even though it is not exactly the same as in the other passage. 


:::


:::tip


If the text is **green** in Greek, then **your text** should also be the same (but **grey**).
Normally, if the text is different in the Greek than it should be different in your text, but not always.
