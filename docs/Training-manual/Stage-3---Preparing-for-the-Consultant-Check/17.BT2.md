**Introduction**  The previous module explained how to create a back translation that expresses what a reader understands when he reads or hears the text. There is another type of back translation that is sometimes used and that is a word-for-word style back translation. Some consultants may ask for this style of back translation. If you need to make one of these, you can use Paratext’s project Interlinearizer function.


:::caution

Please note that in Paratext 9 you can only use the Interlinearizer on registered projects.

:::




**Before you start**  You have typed, checked and revised your translation in Paratext and are now preparing for a consultant check by doing a word-for-word back translation. If you want to export the interlinear to a separate project, then before you can start, your Administrator must have created a separate project for your word-for-word back translation. [This is separate from the readable back translation in the previous module.]


**Why this is important**  Your consultant needs to have a copy of your translation in a language they can understand. The back translation done in the previous module is very useful, but there are times when a literal translation is more helpful.


**What you will do**  You will use the project interlinearizer to produce a word for word gloss of the text. Firstly, you will set up the interlinearizer, and then correct any errors. The computer’s initial guesses are often wrong, but it learns as it goes and becomes quite accurate quickly. The idea is for the gloss to be correct even though the word order is not correct. When you are happy with the verse you can approve the glosses and move to the next verse with unapproved glosses.
