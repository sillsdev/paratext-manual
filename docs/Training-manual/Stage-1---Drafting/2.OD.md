**Introduction**  As you work with your text in Paratext 9 you will want to see a variety of resources. In this module, you will learn how to open resources and organise your desktop.


**Before you start** You are getting ready to type text into an existing project. Before you can do this, someone must have already installed the program, created a project for your data and installed resources for you.


**Why is this important?**  The translator who organises his/her desktop well has all the resources necessary for his/her work.


**What are you going to do?** You will start the Paratext 9 program and open a previously saved layout (text combination). If needed you will open other resources, change the arrangement of the windows and resave the text layout.

**Changes in Paratext 9**


The menus changed in Paratext 9.0. To see the menu, you now need to click on the menu icon ≡. There are now two types of menus. 


<div class='notion-row'>
<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5)'}}>

The main Paratext menu is on the title bar. Each window (or tab) has its own menu.

</div><div className='notion-spacer' />

<div class='notion-column' style={{width: 'calc((100% - (min(32px, 4vw) * 1)) * 0.5000000000000002)'}}>

</div><div className='notion-spacer' />
</div>


When you click on one of these menu icons all the menus are displayed, and you just need to click on the command.


:::tip

In this manual, when it says **≡ Paratext**, under **Menu** &gt; **Command** (e.g. **≡ Paratext**, under **Paratext** &gt; **Open**). It means click on the Paratext menu icon ≡, then under the menu (e.g. Paratext) choose the command (e.g. Open).

And when it says **≡ Tab**, under **Menu** &gt; **Command** it means click on the tab menu icon, then under the menu (e.g. Tools) click on the command (e.g. Wordlist). The most common Tab is the project menu so it may just say ”**≡ project** **menu**”.
