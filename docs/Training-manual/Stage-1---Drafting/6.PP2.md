**Introduction**  In this module, you will learn how to update your progress by marking tasks as completed. You will also create a progress report.


**Before you start**  You have been working on your translation and have finished a task. You now want to update your progress.


**Why this is important**  For the Assignments and Progress to work well, you need to mark the tasks you have finished. This allows Paratext 9 to make the next task available for the other team members. It also gives Paratext accurate information on your progress for the reports. Creating a progress report helps you prepare a report for your supervisors and funders.


**What you are going to do**  You will open the assignments and progress window and update the progress made. You will then produce a report.
