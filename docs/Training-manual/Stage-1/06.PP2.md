**Why this is important**
For the project plan to work well, you need to mark the tasks you have finished. This allows Paratext 9 to make the next task available for the other team members. It also gives Paratext accurate information on your progress for the reports. Creating a progress reports helps you prepare a report for your supervisors and funders.
