**Introduction**
In this module, you will check the chapters/verses and the markers using two methods: The Project plan and the menus.


**Before you start**
You have typed your text in Paratext 9. Now you want to start checking. In this module we start with the first two basic checks. The remaining checks are covered in [BC2-Basic Checks](https://sillsdev.github.io/paratext-manual/12.BC2) and [BC3 - Basic Checks](https://sillsdev.github.io/paratext-manual/19.BC3).


**Why this is important**
These checks allow you to be sure that you have all the chapters and verses and that the other markers are correct. It is important to run the chapter/verse check first because all the other checks depend on it. Doing these checks allows you to complete the Drafting stage.


**What you are going to do**
You are going to run the first two basic checks using two different methods. The easiest way is to run the checks from the project plan. However, you can also do the checks from the project menu **(Tools)** if you need to check more than one book at a time.
