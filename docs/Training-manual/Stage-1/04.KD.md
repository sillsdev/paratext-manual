**Introduction**
This module explains how to keyboard your draft translations into a project in Paratext 9.


**Where we are**
We are about to keyboard text into an existing project. Before you can do that, someone must have already installed the program and created a project for your data.


**Why this is important**
This is the first stage of entering your translation into the computer. Once the text has been typed, you can run various checks on the content and format of the text.


## 4.1 Go to a Biblical verse {#e0b0981ddc00462390d455d768eb6b66}


:::tip


Before you can start typing your text, you need to move your cursor to the right book, chapter and verse. You use the toolbar to do this. :::

- Using the icons on the toolbar, change the project, book, chapter and verse as needed.

:::caution Upgrade 


In Paratext 9.3 you can copy and paste a scripture reference into the book name on the navigation bar. For example, in English: MAT 12.3, Mrk 5:4, Galatians 1:12. 


:::

:::tip

If you don't know the verse reference, you could use the **Find** feature to look for a word. Ctrl+F. 

:::




## 4.2 Check that the project is editable {#1dcaf175a02c4900bd2fd204b38bc71b}

1. Look at the titlebar of your project.

	![](/notion_imgs/215536542.png)

	- _The titlebar should have the word (Editable)._
1. If the book is not editable, and you need to edit it, you should talk with your project administrator.
1. If it is not editable, try changing the view (see below).

## 4.3 Changing the view {#36db52f375d0400aa15c4227b7411e3b}


:::tip


Paratext 9 has five views. All but the Preview view are editable. :::

- **Ctrl** + **E** -or-
- **≡ Tab** under **View** menu, choose the view (usually Standard).

## 4.4 Typing special characters {#a284290c145e436e965523205da6899e}


:::tip


Some orthographic characters are not found on the keyboard. To type these characters, you need to press more than one key. 


:::

1. Change your keyboard system as needed on your computer.
1. If you are using Keyman then choose your keyboard (e.g. Tchad Unicode
(or for MS-Keyboards choose AF or TR/SQ/TZ/AF…)
1. Type the keys for the special character (see chart).

:::tip


You can use **≡ Tab** under **View** &gt; **Highlight Invalid Characters** to quickly see if you have typed any invalid characters. 


:::


## 4.5 Adding text in another marker – title or introduction {#35a84b9611564ce8bc113930126f180d}


:::tip


Each piece of text needs to have a marker. The markers for the chapters and verses are already in your project. When you want to add text such as headings, or introductions etc you need to also add the appropriate marker as follows: 


:::

1. Move your cursor to the end of the previous paragraph:
1. Type **Enter** or type **\**
1. Type the marker (e.g. s1 or ip) **Enter** (or select it from the list).
1. Type the text
1. Add a paragraph marker after the
(for example: \p)

:::tip


You must always have a USFM marker after a title and before the verse. This is usually \p (paragraph), but it can be different (for example \q1). 


:::


## 4.6 Add paragraph breaks {#fa7e583a4c404bb1807e6f1b0af482eb}


:::tip


Dividing the text into paragraphs: 


:::

1. Move the cursor to where you want to break the paragraph.
1. Press **Enter**
1. Type p, then **Enter**.

## 4.8 Insert Footnotes {#1fcb04da221448a1ad490539e82e7564}


:::tip


You can add footnotes in the text at the place where you want the reference to appear. 


:::

- Move the cursor to where you want to insert the footnote.
1. **≡ Tab**, under **Insert** &gt; **Footnote**
	- _A set of footnote markers is added in the box below the text_

## 4.9 Send/receive {#e2bc77b12dfe4cc0a9404298d178d27a}

It is essential to have a second copy of your translation and to share your work with others in your team. This is done by doing a send/receive as follows:
