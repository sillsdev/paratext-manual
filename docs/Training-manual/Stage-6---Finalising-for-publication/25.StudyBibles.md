# 25. Creating a Study Bible with Paratext 9.2 (and above) {#98137245ea6a44b79015596b67b3c634}


**Introduction**  With Paratext 9.2 (and above) you can create a study Bible based on your translation by adding introductory paragraphs, sidebars and detailed footnotes and additional cross-references to help your user have a deeper understanding of the Bible text.


**Where are you in the process?**  Before you can create a study Bible you will want to translate and consultant check your New Testament (or portions). Then your administrator can create a new project (see below).


**Why is this important?**  Study Bible information is created in a separate project with links to the translated text. If the translated text changes the link can be broken. Links can be fixed, but it is less likely to be a problem if the text is stable.


**What will you do?**  You (or your administrator) will create a **Study Bible Additions project**. As the name suggests, this is where you can add the study materials (without affecting your translation).


This separate project contains a read-only copy of your project and your additional text. When you are ready you can merge the Study Bible Additions project with your translation project into a third project.

- Create a new project of Study Bible Additions based on your translation
- Register the new project
- Add the additional material (introductions, sidebars, footnotes and cross-references)
- Hide any non-biblical text in the base translation (e.g. headings)
- Merge the projects to create a publication project.
